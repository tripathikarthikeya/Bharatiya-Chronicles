🚩 Bharatiya Chronicles
Bharatiya Chronicles is an immersive digital ecosystem designed to preserve, promote, and experience the rich heritage and culture of India. By integrating Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Gamification, we bridge the gap between ancient history and the modern world.
Explore the unexplored, shop from the heart of rural India, and travel through time in a massive 3D open world.

Interactive Choices: Decide the path of historical figures to see "what if" scenarios.
👓 AR Exploration Mode (At-Home Discovery)Bring India’s monuments and artifacts into your living room.
Holographic Artifacts: Inspect 3D models of rare sculptures or jewelry.
Portal Mode: Walk through a digital portal to find yourself standing in the middle of Hampi or the Sun Temple
.🛍️ The "Hidden Gems" MarketplaceA dedicated platform for under-recognized artisans and local shops.
Local Impact: Direct access to famous and non-famous shops from remote corners of India.
