* **Dynamic UI:** Adapts based on the user's location and "Chronicler Rank."

### 🎙️ 2. AI-Interactive Audiobooks
Transforming passive listening into an active dialogue.
* **Real Audiobook Integration:** High-quality human narrations serve as the foundation.
* **Contextual AI:** Powered by an LLM trained on historical texts, users can pause the audio and ask, *"Why was this temple built here?"* or *"What was the economic status of this era?"*
* **Multilingual Support:** Seamlessly switch between Sanskrit, Hindi, English, and regional dialects.

### 🏠 3. AR Exploration Mode (At-Home)
Experience the grandeur of India without leaving your room.
* **Portal Technology:** Place a digital door in your room; walk through it to stand inside the *Ajanta Caves* or the *Konark Sun Temple*.
* **Artifact Inspection:** High-poly 3D scans of museum artifacts that users can rotate and inspect in their physical space.
* **Working AR Mode:** Real-time lighting and surface detection for a grounded, realistic experience.

### 🛍️ 4. "Antar-Desh" Marketplace
A social-commerce platform for the "Unseen India."
* **Hyper-Local Focus:** Discover artisans from under-recognized villages (e.g., *Channapatna* toys or *Kutch* embroidery).
* **Direct-to-Artisan:** Connecting users directly with famous and non-famous local shops.
* **Verified Lore:** Every product comes with a digital certificate explaining its cultural history.

### 🏆 5. Gamified Leaderboard
A reward system designed to encourage deep exploration.

* **Chronicler Levels:** Progress from a *'Pathfinder'* to a *'Maha-Chronicler'*.
* **Badges:** Unlock digital collectibles for completing historical sets (e.g., "The Temple Architect" badge).

### 🎮 6. 3D Open World: The Lore Engine
A massive, explorable 3D environment that serves as the ultimate historical playground.
* **Timeline Shifts:** Travel through the same geographical location in different eras (e.g., *Varanasi* in 500 BCE vs 1500 CE).
* **Companion System:** * **AI Sage:** A personalized guide that interprets ancient scripts and provides hints.
    * **Online Companion:** Multiplayer mode to discover hidden lore and solve environmental puzzles with friends.
